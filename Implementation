# Student Accommodation Network Simulation Project
1. Introduction
The goal of this project was to simulate and better understand the network infrastructure of my student accommodation. As a networking student, I was curious about how the network manages over 20+ buildings and provides internet access to hundreds of students. This simulation aimed to propose a logical and practical design while addressing inefficiencies observed in the existing setup.


2. Investigation and Findings
Through observation and research:
•	I discovered that each building has a dedicated room with network switches.
•	Every room has an access point for Wi-Fi connectivity.
With these findings I went on to design the network in the following way
